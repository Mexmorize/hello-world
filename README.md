From me, to the world

My interdisciplinary passion to combine biochemistry with computer science and business is what drives me to learn more every day.
Although I will be graduating soon, I cannot imagine a future for me that does not involve continuous learning.
I consider my identity that of “the learner” as with both life sciences and computer sciences having new fascinating discoveries daily.
